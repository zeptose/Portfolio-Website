                data migration and dealing with data reports in BOBJ, SAP, as well as Qlik. Last Fall I worked as a

                and also improved SEO for their website. I also have expirence as a teaching assistant
                for 15-110, a fast-paced introductory CS class taught in Python.I'm also involved on campus as a member of CMU's Asian Students Association, the Club Tennis team, the Chess Club, as well as a 
                membership development chair for <a href="https://www.phideltcmu.org/members.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

            <p> Some cool fun facts about me are that I lived in Hong Kong for 7 years and I am fluent in both English and Mandarin. 
                I also used to play chess professionally and represented the Hong Kong National Chess team in Hungary back in Middle School.
                My favorite music artist is Illenium, and I enjoy going on long walks through Central Park in my free time.   </p> <br></br>
